Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular
board containing hidden \mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues
about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written for many computing platforms in use
today. It has many variations and offshoots.

The player is initially presented with a grid of undetermined squares. Some randomly selected
squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines. Typically, the size of the grid and
the number of mines are set in advance by the user.

The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square.
If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit
is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines. The player
uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely reveal each
square or mark the square as containing a mine.
